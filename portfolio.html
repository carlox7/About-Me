    <h3>Portfolio</h3>

    <p>
      Carlo does not have a lot of material for a portfolio as he has only just started his development career. Carlo has completed the beginning HTML/CSS and Javascript lessons in Code Academy and does have a few samples of written code there. With time Carlo hopes to have many projects to add to his portfolio.
